📌 Interactive Personal Portfolio Website

📝 Problem Statement

In today’s digital age, traditional resumes and static CVs no longer provide an engaging way to showcase an individual’s skills, achievements, and creativity. Employers and peers prefer interactive, visually appealing platforms that can quickly highlight a person’s professional identity, projects, and technical strengths. The lack of interactivity, personalization, and modern design in conventional resumes creates a significant gap in personal branding for students and professionals. This project solves that issue by building an Interactive Personal Portfolio Website that presents personal details, skills, and projects in a responsive and dynamic manner with bold typography, smooth navigation, and modern styling.
